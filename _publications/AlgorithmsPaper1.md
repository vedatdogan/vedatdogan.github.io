This paper presents a comprehensive Bayesian optimization framework for solving multi-objective bilevel optimization problems. The method addresses the challenge of optimizing hierarchical decision structures where both upper-level and lower-level problems involve multiple competing objectives, using Gaussian process-based surrogate models to efficiently explore the solution space.
