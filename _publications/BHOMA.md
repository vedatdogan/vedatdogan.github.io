This paper presents BHO-MA, a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization method that employs multi-objective acquisition functions to efficiently optimize machine learning hyperparameters. The approach addresses the challenge of balancing multiple objectives in automated machine learning pipelines, such as model accuracy and training time.
