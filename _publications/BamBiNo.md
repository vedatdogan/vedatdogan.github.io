This paper introduces a batch Bayesian optimization framework for addressing bilevel multi-objective decision-making problems under uncertainty. The method enables efficient exploration of hierarchical decision structures where upper-level decisions must account for lower-level optimization responses, while handling multiple competing objectives and uncertain environments.
