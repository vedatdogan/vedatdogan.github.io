I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, University College Cork, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Optimization. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from University College Cork (2023) with a thesis on "Bayesian Bilevel Optimization" and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mathematical Engineering from Yildiz Technical University, where I graduated with Honors (Top 10 of class).

My research focuses on developing AI-supported decision-making systems using game-theoretic optimization models. I work on solving hierarchical multi-level optimization problems with advanced machine learning techniques, including Bayesian optimization, bilevel optimization, and multi-objective decision-making under uncertainty. Currently, I am extending my work to network representation data and exploring graph neural network (GNN) algorithms for complex optimization challenges.

I have published several papers in top-tier conferences including AAAI, ECAI, and specialized workshops on optimization and machine learning. My research interests span:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Diplomacy, military applications, supply chain management, environmental economics, and game-theoretic decision-making systems
- **Machine Learning**: Automated machine learning, multi-task learning, meta-learning, and various supervised/unsupervised learning approaches
- **Optimization**: Bi-level, Bayesian, black-box, multi-objective, hyperparameter, and global optimization methods

I work closely with Prof. Barry O'Sullivan and Dr. Steven Prestwich, along with international collaborators, to create state-of-the-art algorithms and mathematical models for real-world problems. Prior to my academic career, I gained industry experience as a Software Engineer at Garanti Technology (BBVA Group), working on IBM mainframe systems and enterprise software development.

I am passionate about advancing the field of AI and optimization, and I am always eager to collaborate on innovative research projects that bridge theory and practice.
