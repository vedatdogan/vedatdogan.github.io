## Current position
I am a **PhD student** at University College Cork. I conduct research in the fields of **Bayesian optimization**, **bilevel problems** and **operational research problems**, supervised by [Dr. Steven Prestwich](http://publish.ucc.ie/researchprofiles/D005/sprestwich). I am interested in working on improving algorithm performance, black-box optimization and artificial intelligence.

## Past positions
- I have **B.Sc.** in Mathematical Engineering from Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey.
- **Intern** at [Kafein Technology Solutions](https://www.kafein.com.tr/#)
- **Intern** at [Milli Re](https://www.millire.com/ing/anasayfa.html)
- **Software Engineer** at [BBVA Garanti Technology](https://www.garantibbvateknoloji.com.tr/)
